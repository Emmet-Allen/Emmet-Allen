<h1>Welcome! ðŸ‘‹</h1>

<p><strong>Hi, my name is Emmet. Nice to meet you!</strong><p>

<p>I'm a fledging developer, in the midst of a daunting but exciting career change from the medical field to the technology realm.</p>
<p>So far, I'm enjoying the journey quite a bit and I hope that this quick Read Me can give you a little more information on what I'm about. </p>

<h1> From Health to Tech... why?</h1>
  
<p> Well I've always been interested in tech since the days of MySpace and FreeWebs (Remember Those?), my interest then further expanded during my teenage years where I experimented on "not-so-legal" tech. This came in the forms of Homebrew for the Nintendo DS and Nintendo Wii systems, and how the installation and use of these programs and apps enhanced my experience with these systems. I then became more interested in the interaction between hardware and software of these systems, though as life would have it, I went to college and got a degree in Cognitive Science. Now as a more experienced and mature Emmet, I'm revisiting my love for tech.</p>

<h1> So, What Do You Know? </h1>
  
<p> I feel pretty confident in HTML 5, CSS 3, and JavaScript(ES6) skills. I'm currently ranked on LeetCode for JavaScript as a 6th Kyu, something that I am quite proud of.
I am also learning how to use the React framework to better mesh all these skills together. Though, the language that I am most focused on is C++ because I have been preparing for the NYU Tandon Bridge Program 2021 semester, and I have to say, I found a "love from necessity" for the language. </p>

<h1> What Have You Made? </h1>

<p> So far, I've made a responsive minimal HTML/CSS/JS blog template called "Insert Sarcasm Here", A front-page website using BootStrap for up and coming StreetWear brand "City Of Saints And Rebels" with further developement in progress. And a few more basic webpages that you are free to look at within my repositories. In regards to C++ programs, I'm currently making a car maintence program so that I don't have to always search google for the maintence my car needs. </p> 

<h1> Have You Worked On Any Open-Source Projects? </h1>

<p> Why, yes I have! I contributed to a few projects such as OpenSourceMap-Index and the Letra App extension. The contributions were inputting JSON data to those projects, though those projects helped me understand the "In's and Out's" of Github, and Git. </p>
