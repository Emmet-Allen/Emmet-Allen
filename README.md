<p align="center">Neighborhood Problem Solver</p>

<h2 align="center">Languages and Frameworks</h2>

<p align="center">At this point, to many too list between work and school. I've been working with: .Net Core, MSSQL, Azure, React, SvelteKit, C99, Numpy and Jupyter Notebooks</p>
<p align="center"> When I'm a bit freeer, I would like to dive into either Unity or (if it ever comes out to public) S& Box Engine. Or maybe learn Go cause I like C or Kotlin cause I hate Java... eh I'll figure it out</p>
